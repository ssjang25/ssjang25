# ‚≠ê Hi there! I'm Sarah Jang and I'm an aspiring software engineer and a rising junior at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst majoring in Computer Science. I've taken several relevant CS courses at UMass, including: 

- ‚Ä¢ CS 121: An introduction to programming class taught in Java. This course covers Object-Oriented Programming, classes, basic data types, loops, inheritance, recursion, and interfaces. 

- ‚Ä¢ CS 187: A data structures and algorithms course taught in Java. Topics include basic run time (Big O), sorting algorithms and their respective run times (merge, insertion, bubble, etc.), and data structures (linked lists, hash tables, graphs, etc.).

- ‚Ä¢ CS 220: A programming methodology class taught in Javascript/Typescript that focuses on writing efficient code. Topics include higher order functions (filter, reduce, map, etc.), unit and property-based testing, streams, observers, asynchronous programming, fluent design and builders, and interpreter building.

- ‚Ä¢ CS 240: A reasoning under uncertainty class that focuses on statistics and probability. This course covers the summation and multiplication of probabilities, Bayes' rule, permutations and combinations, discrete and continuous random variables, expected value, the cental limit theorem, Markov/Chebyshev inequalities, Markov Chains, Bayesian networks, and Game theory. 

- ‚Ä¢ CS198C: A programming class taught in C. This course covers basic C data types, functions, I/O format, basic pointer manipulation and introduction to using standard tools (gcc and make), all in a terminal environment (Linux shell/command line).


# Currently, 
- üå± I‚Äôm learning Swift and the basics of XCode!

- üî≠ I‚Äôm working on a social media application with my crew.. soon to be published!
