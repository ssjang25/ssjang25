# ‚≠ê Hi there! 
### I'm Sarah Jang and I'm an aspiring software engineer and a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst majoring in Computer Science. I've taken several relevant CS courses at UMass, including: 

- CS 121: An introduction to programming class taught in Java. This course covers Object-Oriented Programming, classes, basic data types, loops, inheritance, recursion, and interfaces. 

- CS 187: A data structures and algorithms course taught in Java. Topics include basic run time (Big O), sorting algorithms (merge, insertion, bubble, etc.), and data structures (linked lists, hash tables, graphs, trees, etc.).

- CS 220: A programming methodology class taught in Javascript/Typescript that focuses on writing efficient code. Topics include higher order functions (filter, reduce, map, etc.), unit and property-based testing, streams, observers, asynchronous programming, fluent design and builders, and interpreter building.

- CS 240: A reasoning under uncertainty class that focuses on statistics and probability. This course covers Bayes' rule, permutations and combinations, discrete and continuous random variables, the cental limit theorem, Markov/Chebyshev inequalities, Markov Chains, Bayesian networks, and Game theory. 

- CS 198C: A programming class taught in C. This course covers basic C data types, functions, I/O format, basic pointer manipulation and introduction to using standard tools (gcc and make), all in a terminal environment (Linux shell/command line).

- CS 250: An introduction to computation course that deals with "discrete mathematics". The covered topics include logic, number theory, induction proofs, search algorithms, regular languages, finite-state machines, and computability. 

- CS 230: An extension of CS 198C that covers the C language and computer systems principles. Topics include programming language run-time systems, concurrency, and synchronization, with a focus on key operating system features, I/O and networking, and distributed services.

- CS 325: A human computer interaction (HCI) course that focuses on Usability, Human Computer Interaction, User Interfaces, and Human Centered Computing. By learning about user interface prototyping, human centered design, and evaluation methodologies, a final hi-fidelity prototype for a hypothetical mobile application was created as the final project for this course.
